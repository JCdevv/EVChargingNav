EVChargingNav (I never thought of an actual name) is a Android mobile application written in Kotlin that provides locations and directions to electric charging stations. Users can filter charging stations based on the connector power types (Single Phase, DC, Triple Phase) as well as whether they are free and located on street. Data pulled from GovUK's National Charging Registry and OpenChargeMap.


## Notes
- API keys for Google Maps and Directions API required.
